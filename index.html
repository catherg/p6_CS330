         <div class="description">
            <p>This project comes from an assignment that I had to complete for CS 396: Generative Methods taught by Kate Compton,
                who gave us some template code to begin with. The point of this assignment was to create four particle swarms with different emergent effects, and 
                have different global forces affect each one (wind, gravity, etc.).</p>
